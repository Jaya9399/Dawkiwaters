            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Finding clean and pure drinking water has always been a worldwide challenge. While a person can survive for days without food, water is an essential need for survival. The scarcity of clean drinking water and the lack of proper water dispensers contribute to this problem. The reliance on non-recyclable plastic bottles for packaged water further exacerbates the issue, harming both humans and the environment. Millions of such bottles end up in landfills daily. Together, we can make a positive change by taking small steps to address this problem.</p>

            <h3>Aim</h3>
            <p>At Dawki Waters, our aim is to provide safe, healthy, and pure drinking water to everyone. We recognize water as a fundamental necessity for survival. To achieve this goal, we offer water dispensers with built-in UV filtration units that not only cool the water but also maintain proper Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and pH levels. Customers can conveniently check the TDS and pH of the water, access cleaning and maintenance services, and make payments by scanning the QR code. Our automatic filling system ensures that you have clean water ready to go!</p>
